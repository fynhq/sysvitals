//! SysVitals History — a GPUI trend chart popup.
//!
//! Launched by the platform overlay when the user clicks the indicator.
//! Shows CPU and memory usage over time as one merged chart, with a time
//! range selector and a Copy CSV button. When the launcher passes the
//! indicator rectangle via `--anchor`, the window opens as a topmost
//! borderless popup beside the indicator; otherwise it opens centered.
//! Closes on Esc or window blur.

// A GUI child process must not allocate a console window on Windows: without
// this attribute the binary is built as a console subsystem executable and a
// terminal flashes up beside the history window every time it launches.

        // window buttons are created. The library's only other lever,
