//! Sampling layer.
//!
//! `sysinfo` is the ONLY place in the whole crate tree that touches a system
//! API. Everything else consumes the pure [`Snapshot`] it produces, so each
//! metric can later be swapped for a native call (`GetSystemTimes`,
//! `GetIfTable2`, `host_statistics`, ...) without changing any caller.
//!
//! Correctness rules baked in here, each unit-testable via a
//! fake counter feed (see `net` tests — they do not need a real NIC):
//! - Rates are differentials of monotonically increasing cumulative byte
//!   counters. A counter below its baseline (wrap-around or driver reset)
//!   yields "no data" (NaN) for that frame rather than a negative rate.
//! - Interface set changes (add/remove/unplug) rebuild the baseline instead
//!   of panicking.
//! - A tick gap far larger than any configured interval means the machine
//!   slept or the process was stalled: the frame is dropped as stale (CPU
//!   re-primes from raw, network reports NaN) so no sleep-spanning rate
//!   reaches the display or the history ([`STALE_GAP_SECS`]).
//! - Only selected physical NICs are aggregated; loopback / VPN / virtual
//!   adapters are excluded by default, with a user override to pin a list.
//! - CPU percent is exponentially smoothed with the `sample.cpu_smoothing`
//!   history weight (0 disables) and clamped.
